Today I’m going to show you how to make a lampshade using a piece of fabric and a lampshade kit. This project is so easy and works out so much cheaper than buying shop bought lampshades ... and it also means you can choose your own fabric! You might remember earlier this year I was gifted a bag in this fabric which is called 'Enchanted Forest' by a designer called Voyage - I thought it was so pretty so I found a supplier called Just fabrics who sold it by the metre and it's currently on sale! The lamp making kit is from a craft company called Dannells - I've made two different types below, the larger one is a drum shade in 40cm and the 'coolie' shade is 30cm. Dannells sell a huge array of lampshade kits in various shapes and sizes, most of which can be adapted for lamps or ceiling lights. Once you've tried your hand at this you will get hooked so be warned! 

When it comes to choosing fabric for this project don't opt for anything too thick, as this will be hard to work with. Also bear in mind what it will look like with light shining through ... perhaps hold it up to a light when choosing. Also, when it comes to choosing fabric a plain colour or repetitive pattern is probably easier as it doesn’t matter where you lay your panel, but because my fabric has a 'scene' I have to make sure the pattern is centralised. If you don't need to centralise your pattern you can hop to step 3.

Iron your fabric so it has no creases. Lay out your fabric - pattern side up. Without peeling the backing from your PVC panel lay it on top covering the area you want to use (use something to weigh it down either end to keep in place if you need too.) When you're happy with your placement put some pins around the panel an inch from edge, just to use as markers.

Flip the fabric so it's pattern side down (though not upside down!) Then remove approx 5 inches from the sticky adhesive and stick it down to one end of the fabric within your markers and press down firmly using your fist.

Once the end is stuck down slowly remove more of the backing bit by bit with one hand while smoothing it down with the other.

Now you're going to cut the panel out, keeping as close to each edge as possible. 

However …. to avoid a frayed edge like the one in the photo below we’re going to leave an extra half a centimetre at one end, which we’ll fold over at a later stage. 

f you're buying a 'coolie' shade for a lamp (bottom right) you'll also need to purchase a shade carrier. 

When making a ceiling shade - make sure the ring with the light fitting (bars) is at the top!

You can also purchase a lovely diffuser that you pop in the bottom of the ceiling shade, they sell them with various cut out patterns. (pic below)
